I am an Applied Economics PhD student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on using observational data to estimate causal relationships in the field of development economics.  I have six years of experience using econometric tools  to answer questions relating to food security, agricultural supply chains and transportation infrastructure. My current work looks at the impact of rural roads on agricultural outcomes.
